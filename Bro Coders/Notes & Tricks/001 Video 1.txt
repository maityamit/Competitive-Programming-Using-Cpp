Observing and Understanding the Problem :

Observing Time Complexity:

10^8 Operations / second

n<=12                 n!
n<=25                2^n
n<=100               n^4
n<=500              n^3
n<=10^4              n^2
n<=10^6              nlogn
n<=10^8               n
n>10^8                logn/1 (mathematical)
